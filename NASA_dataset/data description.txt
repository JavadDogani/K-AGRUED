NASA's dataset was constructed using two traces containing all HTTP requests made to the NASA Kennedy Space Center's web server in Florida over two weeks. 
The initial log was kept from 00:00:00 on July 1 to 23:59:59 on July 31, 1995, a period of 31 days. 
The second log was kept for 31 days, from 00:00:00 August 1, 1995, to 23:59:59 August 31, 1995. There were 3,461,612 requests submitted during these two months. 
Timestamps have a resolution of 1 minutes. 
No accesses were registered between 01/Aug/1995 14:52:01 and 03/Aug/1995 04:36:13, as the Web server was shut down due to Hurricane Erin.
